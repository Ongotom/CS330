1.	How do I approach designing software?
	
o	What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
Most of the design skills I had before were related to text and data organization. I learned how to interact with 3d objects by building and visually manipulating the objects and lighting and views.

o	What design process did you follow for your project work?
I did one object to completion/satisfaction before moving onto to the next, having that first object set the tone and standard for scaling and other options.

o	How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
Eating the whale one bite at a time and in organized chunks. With no prior animating experience the task seemed quite large, but broken down into manageable chunks makes me feel like these wasn’t so difficult. 

2.	How do I approach developing programs?

o	What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
This was my first time creating an executable file that could run independently so learning the file structure and compression techniques was new.

o	How did iteration factor into your development?
A lot of things like lighting and rotation were guess and check, so I ran the program hundreds of times to get it just right.

o	How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the project’s completion?
Getting more familiar with the IDE especially the “Find all references” was instrumental in understanding the calls and variables. I was able to call everything with no problem by the last week.

3.	How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
	
o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
For me I think it’s just understanding existing software and new uses of the languages I’m learning. If C++ is my language then OpenGL is like poetry or short story writing.

o	How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
Exposure to widely used code can do nothing but benefit me. I have not decided where I want this CS degree to finally take me, so having this as a starting point if I want to pursue more graphical based programming is valuable.
